Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code, collaborate with others, and manage their codebase efficiently.

"Get Git" refers to downloading Git software and installing it on your computer.

Configuring Git involves setting up your name and email address to identify yourself when making commits, as well as configuring other settings like editor preferences.

The "Get help" command allows you to access Git's documentation and get information on specific commands.

Initializing a repository creates a new Git repository in your current directory.

Using "Git status" shows you the current state of your repository, including which files have been modified or staged.

Tracking and untracking files allows you to add files to the staging area for commit or remove them from tracking.

You can create a .gitignore file to specify which files or directories Git should ignore.

Tracking all files adds all modified files to the staging area for commit.

Committing creates a new commit with the changes in the staging area.

Changing files and viewing differences allows you to see what changes have been made since the last commit.

Bypassing staging and committing immediately commits changes without adding them to the staging area.

Deleting or removing files from the repository removes them from tracking.

Restoring files allows you to retrieve deleted or modified files from a previous commit.

Renaming files in the repository changes the file names while keeping their history intact.

Viewing commit history with git log shows you a list of previous commits and their details.

Amending a commit allows you to modify the last commit's message or add new changes to it.

Viewing changes in commits gives you a detailed view of the changes made in each commit.

Resetting to a previous commit reverts your repository to a specific commit, discarding any changes made after that point.

Rebasing the Git repository allows you to reapply commits on top of another branch.

Branches in Git allow you to work on different features or versions of your code independently.

Merging branches combines changes from one branch into another branch.

Deleting a branch removes it from the repository.

Merge conflicts occur when there are conflicting changes in different branches that need to be resolved.

The typical Git flow involves creating a new branch, making changes, committing them, merging back to the main branch, and pushing changes to the remote repository.

Setting up a GitHub account is necessary for collaborating with others and sharing your code online.

Creating a new cloud repository on GitHub allows you to store your code remotely.

Pushing a local repository to GitHub uploads your code to the remote repository.

Working with files involves editing, adding, removing, and managing files in your repository.

Editing repository details allows you to change repository settings, descriptions, and other information.

Managing issues in a repository helps track bugs, feature requests, and other tasks.

Pull requests are requests to merge changes from one branch into another branch, typically used for code review and collaboration.

GitHub's additional features like Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, and Settings provide tools for managing and analyzing your repositories.

Releases in GitHub allow you to create a tagged snapshot of your code at a specific point in time.

Fetching and pulling fetches changes from a remote repository and updates your local repository with those changes.
